        <head>Getting there from here: Remembering the future of digital humanities</head>

        <p>In this talk I look back on a life of learning in digital humanities and on the past of literary computing. Personal retrospection yields a moral; another arises from my highly referential style of writing. But my overall aim is to pick  out from the incunabular period (1949-1991) clues pointing to the trajectory  of a discipline that has survived decades of neglect to become popular but  is not yet able to articulate an agenda of as well as in the humanities. The  Web and what we have made from it were sufficient for popularity. Many have  been well served, are grateful and want to do more; others see opportunity  to extend the reach of their native research. But beyond providing material  for that which happens elsewhere by other means by other people we remain  largely as we were before the Web. In this lecture I argue that the key to a  scholarly life in digital humanities worth living has been visible all along, by  taking seriously what happens where we stand: at the traumatic cross-roads  of the humanities and computing.</p>
