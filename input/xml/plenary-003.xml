        <head>Is there anybody out there? Building a global DH community</head>
        
        <p>Digital Humanities has come a long way towards establishing itself as a dynamic and innovative field of study. It has been pointed out however that an important area for further development is a broader internationalization of the Digital Humanities community.   Currently most of the available literature is centered on DH projects in a handful of mainly English speaking countries. An important challenge for the DH community is to extend its international reach and integrate work from a wider range of languages and academic institutions. Presently there are numerous initiatives under way that aim to broaden Digital Humanities regional and linguistic diversity. In this talk I will discuss some of the issues with identifying DH scholars and establishing networks of collaboration drawing on specific examples of setting up the Red de Humanidades Digitales (RedHD). </p>
